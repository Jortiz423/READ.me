About me:
Hello Everyone, I am Jordan, this is my 2nd year at NCC and I'm interested in obtaining a bachelors in aerospace engineering. So something I am interested in learning is all about the software and operations of computers since I will be working with them so much, we use them everyday not thinking much about them and just expecting them to work. My favorite hobby is gaming on my gaming laptop that can handle anything I throw at it. I am an Firefighter & EMT, volunteering at 2 different firehouses and working full time for an EMS company, I am all about adventure!!
